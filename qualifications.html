                    Currently, I am doing research under <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Muzahid-Abdullah.html" target="_blank">
                    Dr. Abdullah Muzahid </a> on utilizing <strong>Verilog</strong> and the <strong>

                    <strong>LLM-centric processor</strong>. Our team is identifying onging optimiziations to develop
                    AI-focused CPUs as cost-effective alternatives to GPUs, pushing the conventional boundaries of hardware in relation to 
                    AI- an effort which reflects my ability to understand and adapt to individual and team-based environments.

                    Beyond research, I am proficient in various machine learning concepts including neural networks, deep learning, gradient 
                    descent, and optimization techniques utilizing Python. Along with this, I understand the Verilog HDL as well as C++ and Java
                    to a high level.

                    My passions lies at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and software devleopment, where <strong>innovation</strong> 
                    and <strong>exploration</strong> meet ideas rooted in <strong>practicality</strong>. I've developed a diverse set of 
                    projects that reflect my committment to learning and applying new skills and am eager to bring this 
                    understanding to the industry. Beyond this, I am also looking into various machine learning techniques and applications as a means to continuously 
                    understand and apply what I am learning to bring further creativity.
