                    I have participated in different hackathons and competitions and through these events, I have collaborated with various teams
                    and applied my skills to intriguing projects. I would like to give back by helping even the <strong>younger individuals</strong> 
                    who perhaps don't know what they should do in a hackathon. These individuals could be <strong>discouraged</strong> to participate due to 
                    them thinking they are <strong>not adequate</strong> enough and because to that, I would like to, in the future, 
                    help these individuals in any way I could as I was once in their shoes.

                    While I have yet to dive into things like <strong>educating people</strong>, this is also an area I would like to contribute to. Creating 
                    workshops based on things like <strong>basic machine learning concepts</strong> or <strong>data visualization</strong> techniques for beginners
                    and people who are new to the space, I feel would be very helpful. These "hard-to-approach" concepts will be made easier 
                    by doing this and as a result, the field <strong>as a whole</strong> will innevitably grow, even if only by a little bit by this influence.

                    These aspirations are in-line with my <strong>overarching goal</strong> of utilizing my technical skills to bring out the 
                    <strong>creativity</strong> within not only myself but the individuals around me.
